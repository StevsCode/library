Library App is a JavaScript project that allows users to manage their book collection by adding, removing, and 
updating entries while tracking their reading status. It focuses on efficient data handling and UI separation, 
leveraging object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling. Unique book IDs are generated 
using crypto.randomUUID(), and form submissions are managed with event.preventDefault() for a smooth user 
experience. The project also integrates Git and GitHub for version control. Future improvements include local 
storage, search functionality, and enhanced UI/UX.
